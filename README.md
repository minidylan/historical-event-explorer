Historical Event Explorer

This application allows people to randomize a historical event. 

The output will pull a histical event by random and output the following:

1) Date of event
2) Title of the event
3) Small descrption of that event
4) Links to that event via popular sites
5) Book links to that historical event or a typical time around the event
6) Youtube links to that historical event

This project is a work in progress and is mostly used for a random historical event that has happend in history and if i'm interested in that event then I can do some more deep dives around that event.
